MAGIC	GWAS	MAGIC_2hrGlucose_AdjustedForBMI	MAGIC_2hrGlucose_AdjustedForBMI	"Data on glycaemic traits have been contributed by MAGIC investigators and have been downloaded from www.magicinvestigators.org.  2hr Glucose datasets were generated by a meta-analysis of nine GWAS in 15,234 non-diabetic individuals and a follow-up of 29 independent loci in 6,958-30,620 individuals (Saxena et al). (i) Dupuis J et al, New genetic loci implicated in fasting glucose homeostasis and their impact on type 2 diabetes risk. Nat Genet. 2010;42:105-16, for data from the meta-analysis results for fasting glucose, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR and HOMA-B. (ii) Saxena R et al, Genetic variation in GIPR influences the glucose and insulin responses to an oral glucose challenge. Nat Genet. 2010:42:142-8 for data from the 2hr glucose GWAS. (iii) Soranzo N et al, Common variants at 10 genomic loci influence hemoglobin A1(C) levels via glycemic and nonglycemic pathways. Diabetes 2010: 59;12;3229-39 for HbA1c data. (iv) Strawbridge R et al, Genome-wide association identifies nine common variants associated with fasting proinsulin levels and provides new insights into the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes for proinsulin data. Diabetes2011; 60;10;2624-2634 for proinsulin data."	"Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1"	D003922													mod_MAGIC_2hrGlucose_AdjustedForBMI.tsv
